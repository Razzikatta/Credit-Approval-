Our goal is to help HereIsTheMoney more deeply understand their target market. We have found opportunities for marketing to more efficiently allocate budget to both acquire new clients and grow revenues from existing clients.
The data we used includes 4 tables, which represent individual loans (credit records), individual applications (application record), and demographic information about the borrowers.
